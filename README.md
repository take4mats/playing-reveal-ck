# playing-reveal-ck
simple presentation slide publishing with reveal-ck

## authoring slide contents
- edit `slides.md`.  note that the file name cannot be changed.  the tool reveal-ck watches `slides.*`.
- syntax? read the doc.

## check how it works in localhost
run `reveal-ck serve` to see it in live reload mode.

## publish
`reveal-ck generate` will do and output static files are put under `slides` dir.
